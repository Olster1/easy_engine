HOW THE RENDERER SHOULD WORK:

There are buffers that are preallocated that take in instance data to a certain size, 
this being the max size of instances * the size of each instance data. This might be different 
depending on the type your trying to render. 

Each batch would have one of these buffers to write into. Again being an arbitrary length, we then fill the 
buffer up over the frame. Then when we go to draw, we just bind the buffer and draw. 

BATCH: 
-VAO with a static buffer & index buffer
-InstancingBuffer[sizeof(instacingData)*maxInstanceCount]
-Shader
-Any other info
